{"name":"Mobile PaaS by CloudBees","tagline":"Mobile Platform As A Service - build apps, not infrastructure","body":"### CloudBees mobile services\r\nThis project showcases CloudBees mobile services. We have assembled a showcase of several template projects that you can refer to, build on that show the full range of CloudBees mobile services, from building mobile apps, deploying server apps, integrating data, push messages - all hosted, by us.\r\n\r\n## The demo app\r\nThis app is made up of iOS and Android apps, as well as integration, databases, server apps, and more - all to build a \"restaurant review\" service - called \"gasp\" - A pun on \"yelp\" - get it? Nevermind, it is just a sample. Restaurants are reviewed and geotagged, updates to restaurant views are pushed out to phones once a change in the data is detected.\r\n\r\nThe best way to explore and see the code, docs, is to click around the map, that shows the moving parts:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/mobilepaas/mobilepaas.github.io/master/mobilepaas.github.io.png\" usemap=\"#planetmap\">\r\n\r\n<map name=\"planetmap\">\r\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"0,0,82,126\" href=\"http://www.unsw.edu.au\" alt=\"Sun\">\r\n  <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"90,58,3\" href=\"mercur.htm\" alt=\"Mercury\">\r\n  <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"124,58,8\" href=\"venus.htm\" alt=\"Venus\">\r\n</map>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nMore questions?
